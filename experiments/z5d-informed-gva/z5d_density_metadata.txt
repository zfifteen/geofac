Z5D Prime Density Simulation Metadata
==================================================
N = 137524771864208156028430259349934309717
sqrt_N = 11727095627827384440
log(sqrt_N) = 43.908434
Base PNT density = 2.277467e-02
Bin width = 1000
Total bins = 2001

Note: This is a SIMULATED density histogram based on PNT.
It represents expected prime density behavior but is not
derived from actual prime enumeration around √N₁₂₇.
