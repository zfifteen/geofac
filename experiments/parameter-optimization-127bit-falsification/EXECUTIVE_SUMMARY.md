# Executive Summary: Parameter Optimization 127-bit Falsification

**Experiment Date**: 2025-11-28T12:36:39.691627

## Verdict

**HYPOTHESIS FALSIFIED**

## Falsification Reasons

- Lower threshold generates too many false candidates without finding factors

## Key Findings

### Gate 1 (30-bit) Regression Test
- Defaults: ✓ PASS
- Proposed: ✓ PASS

### Gate 2 (60-bit) Regression Test
- Defaults: ✓ PASS
- Proposed: ✓ PASS

### 127-bit Challenge (Reduced Budget)
- Defaults: ✗ FAIL
- Proposed: ✗ FAIL

### Threshold Analysis
- Default threshold (0.85): 9.1% pass rate
- Proposed threshold (0.15): 24.5% pass rate
- False positive risk: MODERATE

## Conclusion

The hypothesis claims that:
1. Lower threshold (0.15 vs ~0.82) catches weak resonances
2. Wider k-range [2, 17] finds additional resonances
3. Fixed samples (50000) is sufficient for 127-bit

Our testing shows:
- Lower threshold significantly increases false positive rate
- Wider k-range dilutes search effectiveness
- Parameter optimization alone does not reliably solve 127-bit

## Recommendations

1. Keep scale-adaptive parameter tuning
2. Do not reduce threshold below 0.5 (noise floor)
3. Keep k-range narrow and centered (~0.30 to 0.40 for 127-bit)
4. Focus on algorithm improvements rather than parameter tuning
