This document has been superseded by the official validation gate policy.

For a complete description of the project's acceptance criteria, validation targets, and operational scope, please refer to the canonical document:

**[./VALIDATION_GATES.md](./VALIDATION_GATES.md)**

All new and existing work must adhere to the policy defined in that file.
