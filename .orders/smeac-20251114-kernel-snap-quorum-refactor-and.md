## S (Situation → Context & Problem)
Summarize the current problem, constraints, and signals. Include why this matters now.

## M (Mission → Objective)
Define the single, measurable outcome. State explicit success criteria and validation gates.

Ordered steps (minimal diffs). Deterministic methods only; no classical fallbacks. Include parameters, thresholds, and stop conditions.

## A&L (Administration & Logistics → Artifacts & Repro)
List artifacts to write (logs, JSON, CSV), exact commands to repro, precision rule, timestamps, and where outputs are stored (.orders, results/...).

## C&S (Command & Signal → Coordination & Interfaces)
Point to issues/PRs, owner/assignees, and interfaces (files/classes) to modify. Include how contributors report results.
