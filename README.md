## Geofac — Singular Objective: Factor N via Geometric Resonance (No Fallbacks)

### Target N
`137524771864208156028430259349934309717`

Geofac is a Spring Boot + Spring Shell application that implements the geometric resonance factorization algorithm in pure Java. This repo has a single objective: factor the challenge semiprime `N` above using resonance-only search. All fallback methods (Pollard Rho, ECM, QS, etc.) are removed or unreachable—the code path is 100 % geometric.

### Why it exists
- Deliver a reproducible, deterministic geometric-resonance factorization for this specific `N`.
- Provide a tight, auditable test harness (Spring Boot, JUnit 5, Gradle).
- Offer an interactive CLI for iterating resonance parameters only.

### Non-negotiables
- **No fallbacks** – the system never drops into Pollard Rho, ECM, QS, or any probabilistic helper.
- **Resonance-only search paths** – Dirichlet kernel gating + golden-ratio QMC drive every candidate.
- **Reproducibility** – fixed seeds, frozen configs, and exported artifacts per run.

### Key features (resonance-only)
- **High-precision core** – `FactorizerService` uses `ch.obermuhlner:big-math`, Dirichlet kernel gating, golden-ratio quasi Monte Carlo sampling, and phase-corrected snapping.
- **Configurable search** – sampling range, kernel order (`J`), thresholds, and precision live in `application.yml`.
- **Spring Shell CLI** – run `factor <N>` inside the embedded shell with deterministic logs.
- **Proof artifacts** – each run writes `factors.json`, `search_log.txt`, `config.json`, and `env.txt`.

### Getting started
Prerequisites
- JDK 17
- Git & Gradle wrapper (bundled)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfifteen/geofac.git
cd geofac
./gradlew bootRun
```

At the `shell:>` prompt, run the challenge semiprime:

```shell
shell:>factor 137524771864208156028430259349934309717
```

On success the CLI prints `p`, `q`, verifies `p * q == N`, and writes artifacts under:

```
results/N=137524771864208156028430259349934309717/<run_id>/
├─ factors.json
├─ search_log.txt
├─ config.json
└─ env.txt
```

If no factors are found within the configured budget, the run exits cleanly. No alternative methods are attempted.

### Configuration
`src/main/resources/application.yml` → `geofac.*`

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `precision` | `240` | Minimum decimal digits for the BigDecimal math context (auto-raised with input size). |
| `samples` | `3000` | Number of k-samples explored per attempt. |
| `m-span` | `180` | Half-width for the Dirichlet kernel sweep over `m`. |
| `j` | `6` | Dirichlet kernel order. |
| `threshold` | `0.92` | Normalized amplitude gate before evaluating a candidate. |
| `k-lo`, `k-hi` | `0.25`, `0.45` | Fractional k-sampling range. |
| `search-timeout-ms` | `15000` | Max time per attempt; on timeout the command exits (no fallback). |

Override via Spring config (profiles, env vars, command-line args) as needed.

---

### Testing
```bash
./gradlew test
```

This runs validation tests plus the long 127-bit reference scenario. For manual resonance runs, use the CLI example above. Heavy, multi-minute factor attempts intentionally stay out of default CI.

### CI & proof requirements
- CI shard runs with pinned seeds and expects stdout proof: `p`, `q`, `p*q == N`.
- Artifacts from `results/N=.../<run_id>/` must be captured for verification.

### Contributing
This repo has a single goal: factor `N` above via geometric resonance only. PRs must explain how they advance that goal. Introducing or re-enabling fallback methods is out of scope.

### Roadmap (strictly in-scope)
1. Parameter grid refinement for better early-hit ranking.
2. Deterministic progress logs plus lightweight amplitude histograms.
3. CI artifact bundling with a one-page proof report (`experiments/N-factorization.md`).
