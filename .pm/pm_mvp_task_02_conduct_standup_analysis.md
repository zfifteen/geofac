### Task 2: Conduct Stand-Up Analysis

Your second task is to perform a high-level analysis of the repository to answer the three core stand-up questions. Your focus is on the project's progress toward the **Gate 1** objective.

1.  **What was accomplished since the last report?**
    *   Review recently merged pull requests and closed issues.
    *   Identify significant accomplishments that move the project closer to the Gate 1 goal.

2.  **What are we working on now?**
    *   Review currently open pull requests and active issues.
    *   Summarize the team's current focus.

3.  **What are our current impediments?**
    *   Look for work items that are blocked or stalled.
    *   Identify the primary technical or strategic blockers mentioned in discussions that are preventing progress toward Gate 1.

Hold your findings in memory. Once you have clear answers to these three questions, proceed to the final task file: `pm_mvp_task_03_publish_report_and_exit.md`.
